What is Abaco
--------------
    
**Abaco** is a web service and distributed sysytem that implements the actor model of concurrent computation whereby each actor registed in the system is associated with the Docker images.

Actor containers are executed in response to a message posted to their inbox which itself is given by a URI exposed via abaco.

Three main things are collected  in the process of excecting a actor container:
 
 * States
 * Logs
 * Statistics
