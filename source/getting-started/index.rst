Getting Started
===============

This Getting Started guide will walk you through the initial steps of setting up the necessary accounts and installing
required software before moving to the Abaco Quickstart where you will create and execute your first Abaco actor. If
you are already using Docker Hub and the TACC Cloud APIs, feel free to jump right to the `Abaco Quickstart`_.

------------------------------------------
Account Creation and Software Installation
------------------------------------------

Create a TACC account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main instance of the Abaco platform is hosted at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (`TACC <https://tacc.utexas.edu>`_).
TACC designs and deploys some of the world's most powerful advanced computing technologies and innovative software
solutions to enable researchers to answer complex questions. To use the TACC-hosted Abaco service, please
create a `TACC account <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request>`__ .

Create a Docker account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__  is an open-source container runtime providing operating-system-level
virtualization. Abaco pulls images for its actors from the public Docker Hub. To register actors
you will need to publish images on Docker Hub, which requires a docker account `Click Here <https://hub.docker.com/>`__ .


Install the TACC Cloud Python SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To interact with the TACC-hosted Abaco platform in Python, we will leverage the TACC Cloud Python SDK. To install it,
simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip3 install agavepy

.. attention::
    While ``agavepy`` works with both Python 2 and 3 we strongly recommend using Python 3.


-----------------------
Working with TACC OAuth
-----------------------

Authentication and authorization to the TACC Cloud APIs uses `OAuth2 <https://oauth.net/2/>`_, a widely-adopted web standard.
Our implementation of OAuth2 is designed to give you the flexibility you need to script and automate use of TACC
Cloud while keeping your access credentials and digital assets secure. This is covered in great detail in our
Developer Documentation but some key concepts will be highlighted here, interleaved with Python code.


Create an OAuth Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to create an OAuth client. This is a one-time set up step, much like creating a TACC account. To do
it, we will use the TACC Cloud API Python SDK. First, import the ``Agave`` class and create python object called ``ag``
that points to the TACC Cloud API server using your TACC username and password. Do so by typing the following in
a Python shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> from agavepy.agave import Agave
  >>> ag = Agave(api_server='https://api.tacc.utexas.edu',
  ...            username='your username',
  ...            password='your password')

Once the object is instantiated, interact with it according to the API documentation and your specific usage needs.
For example, to create a new OAuth client we type the following :

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> ag.clients.create(body={'clientName': 'enter a client name'})

You should see a response like:

.. code-block:: bash

  {'_links': {'self': {'href': 'https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/clients/v2/abaco_quickstart'},
   'subscriber': {'href': 'https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/profiles/v2/apitest'},
   'subscriptions': {'href': 'https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/clients/v2/abaco_quickstart/subscriptions/'}},
   'callbackUrl': '',
   'consumerKey': 'pYV81QNBxkqeC6Nms3XBzk9UJuca',
   'consumerSecret': 'Oug0gdLa3a_Xt37_fwxO6ZGNffUa',
   'description': '',
   'name': 'abaco_quickstart',
   'tier': 'Unlimited'}


Record the consumerKey and consumerSecret in a secure place; you will use them over and over to generate Oauth tokens,
which are temporary credentials that you can use in place of putting your real credentials into code that
is scripting against the TACC APIs.


Reuse an Existing Oauth Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you generate an OAuth client, you can re-use its key and secret:

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> from agavepy.agave import Agave
  >>> ag = Agave(api_server='https://api.tacc.utexas.edu',
  ...            username='your username', password='your password',
  ...            client_name='my_client',
  ...            api_key='pYV81QNBxkqeC6Nms3XBzk9UJuca',
  ...            api_secret='Oug0gdLa3a_Xt37_fwxO6ZGNffUa')


Generate a Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the ``ag`` object instantiated and an OAuth client created, we are ready to generate an OAuth token:

 .. code-block:: bash

  >>> ag.token.create()
  Out[1]: 'c21199177da6dd4d14d659399a933f5'

Note that the token is automatically stored on the ``ag`` object for you. You are now ready to check your access to the
TACC Cloud APIs.

Check Access to the TACC Cloud APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Agave object ``ag`` should now be configured to talk to all TACC Cloud APIs on your behalf. We can check that
our client is configured properly by making any API call. Here's an example: Let's retrieve the current
user's **profile**.

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> ag.profiles.get()
  Out[1]:
  {'email': 'aci-cic@tacc.utexas.edu',
   'first_name': 'API',
   'full_name': 'API Test',
   'last_name': 'Test',
   'mobile_phone': '',
   'phone': '',
   'status': '',
   'uid': 834517,
   'username': 'apitest'}


----------------
Abaco Quickstart
----------------

In this Quickstart, we will create an Abaco actor from a basic Python function. Then we will execute our actor on the
Abaco cloud and get the execution results.

A Basic Python Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose we want to write a Python function that counts words in a string. We might write something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  def string_count(message):
      words = message.split(' ')
      word_count = len(words)
      print('Number of words is: ' + str(word_count))

In order to process a message sent to an actor actor, we use the ``raw_image`` attribute of the ``context`` dictionary.
We can access it by using the ``get_context`` method from the ``actors`` module in ``agavepy``.

.. code-block:: bash

  # example.py

  from agavepy.actors import get_contex

  def string_count(message):
      words = message.split(' ')
      word_count = len(words)
      print('Number of words is: ' + str(word_count))

  context = get_context()
  message = context['raw_message']
  string_count(message)


Building Images From a Dockerfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To register this function as an Abaco actor, we create a docker image that contains the python function and
execute it as part of the default command.

We can build a Docker image from a text file called a Dockerfile. You can think of a Dockerfile as a recipe for
creating images. The instructions within a Dockerfile either add files/folders to the images, add metadata to the
image, or both.

The FROM instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

we can use the ``FROM`` instruction to start our new image from a known image. This should be the first line of our
Dockerfile. We will start an official Python image"

.. code-block:: bash

  FROM python:3.6

The ADD instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can add local files to our image using the ``ADD`` instruction. We can add a the file ``example.py`` in our local directory to the ``Users/kwhitley/PycharmProjects/Test`` directory in our container with the following instruction:

.. code-block:: bash

  ADD example.py /example.py


The last step is write the command from running the application, which is simply - ``python /example.py``. We use
the ``CMD`` instruction to do that:

.. code-block:: bash

  CMD ["python", "/example.py"]

With that, our ``Dockerfile`` is now ready. This is what is looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

  FROM python:3.6

  ADD example.py /example.py

  CMD ["python", "/example.py"]


Now that we have our ``Dockerfile``, we can build our image and push it to Docker Hub. To do so we use the
``docker build`` and ``docker push`` commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ docker build -t user/my_actor .
  $ docker push user/my_actor

Registering an Actor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we are going to register the Docker image we just built as an Abaco actor. To do this we will use the ``Agave``
client object we created above (see `Working with TACC OAuth`_).

To register an actor using the agavepy library, we use the ``actors.add()`` method and pass the arguments describing
the actor we want to register through the `body` parameter. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> from agavepy.agave import Agave
  >>> ag = Agave(api_server='https://api.tacc.utexas.edu', token='<access_token>')
  >>> my_actor = {"image": "user/my_actor", "name": "test", "description": "Actor that counts words."} }
  >>> ag.actors.add(body=my_actor)
  
To get the message from Abaco do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> from agavepy.actors import get_contex
      def string_count():
          context = get_context()
          try:
              message = context['raw_message']
      except Exception as e:
              print("Got an exception parsing message. Aborting. Exception: {}".format(e))
        words = message = "Hey my name is john"
        words = message.split(' ')
        word_count = len(words)
        print('Number of words is: ' + str(word_count))
     string_count()

Executing an Actor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are now ready to execute our actor by sending it a message.

To execute a Docker container associated with a reactor, we send the reactor a message by makeing a **POST** request to the reactors' inbox URL which is in the form of:

.. code-block:: bash

 http://api.tacc.utexas.edu/reactors/v2/<reactor_id>/messages
 
Currently, two types of messages are supported: "raw" string and JSON messages.

Executing Reactors with Raw Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To excute a reactor passing a raw string, make a **POST** request with a single argument in the message body of `message`.
Here is an example using curl:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d "message=some test message" https://api.tacc.cloud/actors/v2/$REACTOR_ID/messages
   
When this request is successful, the reactors service will put a single message on the reactors' message queue which will ultimately result in one container execution with the `$MSG` enviroment variable haiving the value `some test message`.

The same execution could be made using the Python library like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  >>> ag.actors.sendMessage(actorId='NolBaj5y6714M', body={'message': 'test'})


Retrieving the Logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's retrieve the logs from the execution we just made.
